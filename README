Logic Toy
=========

A grid based logic toy

Initially made as a prototype for a small aspect of a game design.

Each cell of a grid can have its own logic function, each side of a tile
(North, East, South and West) can be blank or be either an input or output

Left clicking allows editing a tile.

Right clicking toggles the state of and input tile.

After editing or adding a tile, the circuit may be in an invalid state,
resetting the state fires state change events on all grid inputs allowing
the logic circuit to be reevaluated.


adding a new logic function

first extend the LogicGate class in the logic folder, a logic gate should
only ever have one output. Inputs and outputs can be on any side 

create a new graphic for the gate - look at the size of other gates
take not that the graphic must fit with the rest of the tile, with
a transparent border...
add a new ImageView in the Tile class (this will later be moved to the 
logic class and auto load the png based on class name...)

Tile.setLogicVisual also needs editing (again this will automagically
happen at a later date)
