Logic Toy
=========

A grid based logic toy

Initially made as a prototype for a small aspect of a game design.

Each cell of a grid can have its own logic function, each side of a tile
(North, East, South and West) can be blank or be either an input or output

Left clicking allows editing a tile.

Right clicking toggles the state of and input tile.

After editing or adding a tile, the circuit may be in an invalid state,
resetting the state fires state change events on all grid inputs allowing
the logic circuit to be reevaluated.
